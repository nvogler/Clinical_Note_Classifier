# Clinical Note Classifier
## (2015/2016)

Initially intended to process raw text and import into Microsoft Access. Evolved into a weighted decision tree classifier. Additional features added to highlight words and context leading to decisions made and the strength of those decisions.  

Single file format used to alleviate issues from running on a highly restricted network.
